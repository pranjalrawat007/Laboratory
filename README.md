# Laboratory
Attempt to explore a bunch of applied math/quantitative fields from first principles and essentials.
Over time I want to add content from different fields: 
  * Machine Learning - Decision Trees, Neural Networks
  * Mathematics - e.g. Linear Algebra, SVD
  * Statistics - e.g. ANOVA
  * Econometrics - e.g. F-test for linear regression
  * Optimization - e.g. Linear Programming
  * Actuarial Science - e.g. No Claims Discount Model
  * Signal Processing - e.g. spectral analysis
